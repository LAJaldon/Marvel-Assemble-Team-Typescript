# Marvel-Assemble-Team
Application developed using JavaScript with React and CSS. 
This application uses the Marvel Comics API to allow the user to create a 6 member Marvel team. Future improvement is to allow users to share their created dream team on social media, and to search for more heroes.

To setup application:
## npm install

then: 
## npm start

the port of the application is:
### http://localhost:3000/

Searching for a hero using the search bar updates the character selection list based on the query
